# PageRank Algorithm Web Application

This project implements the **PageRank** algorithm and provides a web interface for users to calculate the PageRank scores of nodes in a network. The application supports multiple input formats including XML, graph drawing, and adjacency matrix.

## Features

- **XML Input**: Upload an XML file representing a directed graph with nodes and edges.
- **Graph Drawing**: Draw the graph directly on the web interface and calculate PageRank scores.
- **Adjacency Matrix**: Provide an adjacency matrix representing the graph, and calculate the PageRank scores.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for building the web application.
- **NetworkX**: A Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
- **Cytoscape.js**: A JavaScript library used for graph visualization.
- **Python 3.x**
